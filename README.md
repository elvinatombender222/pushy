# Pushy

**Pushy** is a self-hosted, web-based notification dashboard inspired by [Pushover](https://pushover.net), designed for personal use on a private network.

Pushy displays rich, grouped notifications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ‚Äî served over a local web server and gated by [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) for secure access.

## üì¨ Sending Notifications

You can trigger a notification by sending a JSON payload via HTTP POST to the included `write_json.php` endpoint.

### üîß Example `curl` Command

```bash
/usr/bin/curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "containerType": "routine",
  "group": "heartbeat",
  "image": "'"$ALERT_ICON"'",
  "subtitle": "'"$ALERT_SUBTITLE"'",
  "details": "'"$DETAILS"'"
}' http://100.100.57.70/Pushy/server/write_json.php

## üõ∞Ô∏è Presence Indicator with Flag Files

Pushy supports optional presence indicators using lightweight `.flg` files.

### Use Case Example

If a file named `on_the_road.flg` is detected in the Pushy root directory, a small icon (e.g., `gpsantenna.webp`) appears in the top-right title bar next to the hamburger menu. This allows for subtle, visual context about device or user state (like whether you're in a car, on the road, or in a particular mode).

### How It Works

- Presence icons are **not clickable**
- The icon is **only shown** when a specific `.flg` file exists
- The logic is handled in JavaScript and requires no server-side scripting

### Customization

You can create and monitor your own `.flg` files, for example:

- `focus_mode.flg`
- `quiet_hours.flg`
- `office.flg`

Then associate each with a different `.webp` icon and add logic to `script.js` as needed.

## üì± Tasker Integration via HTTP (Android Only)

Pushy is a web app and cannot trigger native push notifications. To work around this, Tasker on Android can be configured to receive **HTTP requests** from the Pushy server when a new notification is added.

### How It Works

1. When a new Pushy notification is generated, your server or script sends an **HTTP request** to Tasker on your Android device.
2. Tasker listens for this request and triggers an action such as:
   - Playing a custom audio track
   - Vibrating the phone
   - Turning on the display or dimming it
3. This allows you to receive **real-time alerts** on your phone ‚Äî even if Pushy is not open in a browser.

### Advantages

- No need to keep the Pushy page open
- Does not rely on Firebase or any third-party services
- Works over LAN or Tailscale using secure local HTTP requests

### Limitations

- Only works on Android
- Requires manual setup of Tasker's HTTP listener
- Each device must be individually configured
- Not ideal for supporting multiple users

This solution offers a reliable, user-controlled alternative to push notifications without any cloud infrastructure.
